#### Step 3
Open the "src" directory in your project. Then, open App.js and look at the code written in the file. This file contains the code on what the user will see. Take a guess what you might see when you run this code. Then, run the code by clicking the "Run" button from the top of the menu. After you press "Run" a link will appear on the lower right side of your screen. Copy that link into a new tab and take a look!

#### Step 4
You should see a page that looks like this. Was it as you expected? Also - notice how it tells us to edit src/App.js - lets try it out and see what happens.

#### Step 5
Go back to the App.js file and delete the code inside of the div with the class name "App."

Try adding some HTML to get "Hello World" to appear on the web page instead!
